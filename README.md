# PyBear_analysis
## Overview
A data visualization project to help a ridesharing cab company improve its access to it's services and determine affordability in certain neighborhoods. This can be done by creating a multi - line graph that helped us view the total weekly fares according to the city type namely,

* Urban
* Suburban
* Rural

We had previously analysed the following meterics categorized by the type of city,

* Ride count
* Avareage fare per ride
* Average number of drivers

## Results

### Analysis from the Pyber Dataframe Summary

![Pyber summary DataFrame](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94252681/158004586-3b58e774-d11d-40f9-90be-728148b05635.png)

From the above datframe we can see that the total number of drivers, total fare and number of drivers had a direct impact based on teh type of city. We can see that the total number of drivers and fares increased as the type of city became more urbanized. This showed that the Pyber drivers are not accessible easily in the rural areas.

### Analysis from the Pyber Fare Summary from Inline Chart

* From the above chart we can analyse that the total fare remained showe dhigh peaks around March and April and taking dip towards the middle of April. 
* From the above chart we can analyse that the total fare remained fairly constant in suburban areas except for a peak in Februrary and dip around April. 
* From the above chart we can analyse that the total fare remained fairly constant in rural areas piking in March and April.

## Summary
There are a few recommendations to the CEO to look into the following aspects to improve his profit margin,
* It is also noted that the average fare per driver and the average fare per ride was indirectly propotional to the total drivers in the area. It will be useful to increase the number of drivers in rural and suburban areas and to look for profits in that area.
* It might be helpful to look into the reason for the the increase in fare in April in rural areas because there are dips during late March or early April to better in urban and suburban areas and the cause might be implemented here to better the profit margin.
* We can note that the total number of rides are significantly lower in the rural and suburban areas hence, it might also be useful to research on demand and supply equations in the urban area to implement the same in the other two.
